Hi I'm Nick Larsen I an a software engineer. My interests include:
* CAD/CAM programming - I write custom automation applications for 3D modeling sortware.
* Machine Learning - finished a Master's Degree from Southern Methodist University in December 2022.
* Keyboard Programming
* Clean Code!

Here's my [resume](https://github.com/nlarsen31/Resume/blob/63bc21a0ba4e8d5ea0b39c12b8c58a011f266f35/OnePageResume/resume.pdf)!
Here are a few of my favorite Side projects:
